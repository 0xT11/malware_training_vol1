## Exercise: refactor a loader

Refactor the code in this way that it will be loading the PE into a remote process. Fill the given template, basing on the hints in the comments.

You are given templates for two elements:
+ payload : a DLL to be loaded/injected
+ injector : the executable that will be doing the injection

> ❗ The code  contains hints that will be guiding you through the process of refactoring.
> Use snippets from the directory [lesson2_pe/pe_snippets](../../lesson2_pe/pe_snippets)

+ Start by refactoring the DLL. It should be altered in such a way that it will be able to load its own imports after it was injected to the (potentially remote) target.
